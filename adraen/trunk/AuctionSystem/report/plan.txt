	- use different class for auctionItem and auctionItemInfo 
	- use a timer to purge the items
	- linked list for caching



How the implementation meets the design goals and requirements
	which parts of the specification have been implemented
	whether your solution works as advertised
	how it has been tested

Possible extensions to improve fault tolerance and availability

Performance of the implementation
	appropriate test interfaces
		max thoughput of the system on remote/local invocations

How the system should be expected to be tested
	classes
	test programs
	test data


Consider techniques to enhance the scalability of your system
